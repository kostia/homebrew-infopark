Homebrew for Infopark-SDK
==============
Formulae for Infopark-SDK development for the Homebrew package manager http://brew.sh

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap kostia/infopark` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install kostia/infopark/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```bash
brew install https://raw.github.com/kostia/homebrew-infopark/master/<formula>.rb
```
